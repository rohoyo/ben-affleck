                        <p>Christian Wolff, played by Ben Affleck, is an accountant – one of the most desired in the
                            business. Yet, while he may seem like your run-of-the-mill number puncher, he is renowned
                            around the world. Frequently employed by high-powered clients, he is the number one man to
                            call in the worst of financial situations.</p>
                        <p>Early on in the film, Christian is hired by an up-and-coming prosthetic robotics company
                            after a slight discrepancy in their numbers is discovered by their Junior Accountant Dana
                            Cummings, played by Anna Kendrick. Over the course of one night, Christian plows through
                            their books and ledgers from the past fifteen years, uncovering a discrepancy and a
                            conspiracy that goes deeper than any one had ever imagined.</p>
                        <p>What makes this film different than action movies before it is that Christian suffers from
                            high functioning autism, with a narrow focus and an uncontrollable drive to complete a task
                            being some of the traditional symptoms. For his entire life, he was pushed to overcome his
                            disability and be a valuable member of society. Now as an adult, he has found the strength,
                            resilience and tools to make this possible – to overcome adversity.</p>

                            <p>Doug is part of a gang of thieves, the brains of the group. His Disunity: Basically a
                                good
                                guy doing bad things. After his gang robs the bank, kidnapping Claire in the process,
                                James
                                (who has a violent streak) decides they need to take out Claire as she is a potential
                                witness. Doug says he’ll handle it. He tracks Claire, eventually intersecting, then
                                falling
                                in love with her — another Disunity element, sleeping with a potential enemy (as far as
                                James is concerned). A third Disunity dynamic: Doug is living a lie with Claire because
                                he
                                does not tell her that he was part of the gang that kidnapped her.</p>
                            <p>There are more Disunity elements, both involving Doug’s parents: Doug’s father is serving
                                multiple life sentences in prison because he led a life of crime, also based in
                                Charlestown.
                                So Doug has a father who isn’t around. Also absent is Doug’s mother who, according to
                                family
                                lore, walked out on Doug and his father, never to be heard from again.</p>

                            <p>What does Doug want? To be with Claire. What does he need? To face up to the fact that at
                                his
                                core, he’s a decent and good human being who should not be involved in illegal
                                activities.
                                This puts the story squarely in mythic territory, a modern spin on a classic Western
                                where
                                the gunslinger wants to put away his gun for good — but circumstances don’t allow it.

                            <p>On top of his wittiness, Chuckie is also one of the most loyal dudes you'll ever meet.

                                second he sees Will get ready for a fight, he follows him to help out and tells his

                            <p>At the end of the day, Chuckie is a good enough friend to know that Will needs to escape
                                their childhood neighborhood and go out to do great things. He also gets his wish in the
                                movie's final scene, when he walks up to Will's door and realizes that Will has taken
                                off.
                                Chuckie doesn't know where Will has gone and he doesn't need to know. He's just happy
                                that
                                Will has finally decided to get out of their neighborhood and see the world beyond it.
